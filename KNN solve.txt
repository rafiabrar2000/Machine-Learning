Step 1: Identify the features and distance metric
Features used for comparison:

Gender (F/M): Categorical feature.
Height: Numerical feature.
Since "Gender" is categorical and identical (Pat is F), we will not calculate its distance as it doesn’t differ in this case.

Use the Euclidean Distance formula for numerical features:

d=∣Height of Pat−Height of another person∣
For each record, calculate the absolute difference in height.

Step 2: Calculate distances

1. Kristina

Height: 1.6 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.6∣=0.0
Output: Short

2. Jim

Height: 2.0 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−2.0∣=0.4
Output: Tall

3. Maggie

Height: 1.9 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.9∣=0.3
Output: Medium

4. Martha

Height: 1.88 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.88∣=0.28
Output: Medium

5. Stephanie

Height: 1.7 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.7∣=0.1
Output: Short

6. Bob

Height: 1.85 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.85∣=0.25
Output: Medium

7. Kathy

Height: 1.6 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.6∣=0.0
Output: Short

8. Dave

Height: 1.7 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.7∣=0.1
Output: Short

9. Worth

Height: 2.2 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−2.2∣=0.6
Output: Tall

10. Steven

Height: 2.1 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−2.1∣=0.5
Output: Tall

11. Debbie

Height: 1.8 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.8∣=0.2
Output: Medium

12. Todd

Height: 1.95 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.95∣=0.35
Output: Medium

13. Kim

Height: 1.9 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.9∣=0.3
Output: Medium

14. Amy

Height: 1.8 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.8∣=0.2
Output: Medium

15. Wynette

Height: 1.75 m
Distance from Pat: ∣1.6−1.75∣=0.15
Output: Medium

Step 3: Select the nearest k=5 neighbors

1. Kristina

Gender: Female
Height: 1.6 m
Distance from Pat: 0.0
Output: Short

2. Kathy

Gender: Female
Height: 1.6 m
Distance from Pat: 0.0
Output: Short

3. Stephanie

Gender: Female
Height: 1.7 m
Distance from Pat: 0.1
Output: Short

4. Dave

Gender: Male
Height: 1.7 m
Distance from Pat: 0.1
Output: Short

5. Wynette

Gender: Female
Height: 1.75 m
Distance from Pat: 0.15
Output: Medium

Step 4: Classify based on the majority class
From the 5 nearest neighbors:

Short: 4 neighbors (Kristina, Kathy, Stephanie, Dave)
Medium: 1 neighbor (Wynette)
The majority class is Short.

Final Classification
The instance (Pat, F, 1.6) is classified as Short.
